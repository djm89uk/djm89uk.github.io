# [PicoCTF](./picoctf.md)

[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) is a free computer security game with original educational content built on a capture-the-flag framework created by security and privacy experts at [Carnegie Mellon University.](https://cmu.edu/).

picoCTF provides a practice CTF environment called picoGym to allow individuals to work on their CTF skills outside of a formal CTF event.
